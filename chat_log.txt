[2025-07-17 01:44:11.893664] Bot: ❌ Error: An output parsing error occurred. In order to pass this error back to the agent and have it try again, pass `handle_parsing_errors=True` to the AgentExecutor. This is the error: Could not parse LLM output: `To help you understand time and space complexity in layman's terms, I'll explain them using simple analogies and examples.

### Time Complexity
Time complexity refers to how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases. It's about how long an algorithm takes to complete.

**Analogy:**
Think of it like cooking a meal. If you're making a simple sandwich, it takes a few minutes. But if you're making a complex dish with multiple steps, it takes much longer. Similarly, some algorithms are quick (like finding an item in a sorted list), while others are slow (like searching through an unsorted list).

**Example:**
- **Linear Search:** Imagine you're looking for a specific book in a library. If the books are not organized, you might have to check each shelf one by one. This is like a linear search, where the time it takes increases with the number of books.
- **Binary Search:** Now, if the books are sorted by title, you can quickly narrow down your search. This is like a binary search, where the time it takes doesn't increase as much with the number of books.

### Space Complexity
Space complexity refers to how much memory an algorithm uses as the size of the input increases. It's about how much storage space an algorithm needs.

**Analogy:**
Think of it like organizing a party. If you're having a small gathering, you only need a small apartment. But if you're having a big party, you need a large hall. Similarly, some algorithms use a lot of memory (like storing a large array), while others use less (like using a single variable).

**Example:**
- **Storing a Large Array:** If you need to store a large list of numbers, you need a lot of memory. This is like having a big party and needing a large hall.
- **Using a Single Variable:** If you only need to keep track of a single value, you don't need much memory. This is like having a small gathering and needing a small apartment.

### Summary
- **Time Complexity:** How long it takes to run an algorithm.
- **Space Complexity:** How much memory it uses.

Understanding these concepts helps you choose the right algorithms for your tasks, especially when dealing with large datasets.`

[2025-07-17 02:20:25.941959] User: namasty kya aap muje recursion ke baare m bata sakte hai
[2025-07-17 02:20:25.941959] Bot: Namaste! Recursion in Python is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This method is often used for tasks that can be divided into simpler instances of the same task. For example, calculating the factorial of a number or traversing a tree data structure are common use cases where recursion is applied.

Here’s a simple example to illustrate recursion in Python:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

In this example, the `factorial` function calls itself with a decremented value of `n` until it reaches the base case where `n` is 0. This approach can help solve complex problems more elegantly by breaking them down into simpler parts.

[2025-07-18 04:24:17.656126] Bot: The Bhagavad Gita is a sacred Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is a dialogue between the warrior Arjuna and his charioteer, Lord Krishna, who is an avatar of the god Vishnu. The conversation takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, just before the start of a great war. The Gita addresses various aspects of life, duty, and spirituality, including the concepts of dharma, karma, and yoga. It provides guidance on how to live virtuously and find one's purpose in life. The text is divided into 18 chapters and 700 verses, covering topics such as the nature of reality, the self, and the ultimate goal of life. The Gita emphasizes the idea that individuals are divine and encourages them to fulfill their duties (dharma) while maintaining a detached and selfless attitude. It presents different paths to spiritual realization, including the path of knowledge (jnana yoga), the path of devotion (bhakti yoga), and the path of action (karma yoga).
